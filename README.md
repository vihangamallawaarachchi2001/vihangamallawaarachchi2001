# 👋 Hi, I’m Vihanga (VK)

### Software Engineer | System Architect | Researcher | Builder of Real Things

I’m a **problem-driven software engineer** who loves designing **robust systems**, **scalable architectures**, and **real-world solutions** — from web platforms to robotics middleware.

I don’t just write code that works.
I design systems that **survive**, **scale**, and **fail gracefully**.

## 🧠 What I Actually Do (Beyond Buzzwords)

* 🏗️ **System Architecture** — designing fault-tolerant, modular, production-ready systems
* 🤖 **Robotics & Middleware** — assistive robots, intent engines, recovery systems
* 🔐 **Security & Reliability** — authentication, fault detection, secure logging
* 🌐 **Full-Stack Engineering** — from APIs to UI with clean separation of concerns
* 🧪 **Research-Oriented Development** — building with novelty, not copy-paste

## 🚀 Current Focus

* 🧠 **A.L.T.R.U.S** — *Adaptive Life-support & Therapeutic Robotic Unit System*

  > A Baymax-inspired assistive robot with:

  * Intent-driven middleware
  * Fault detection & auto-recovery
  * Blockchain-backed immutable event logging
  * Developer CLI & monitoring tools

* 🧩 **Middleware Engineering**

  * Intent arbitration engines
  * Modular plugin systems
  * Event-driven architectures

* 🛡️ **Cybersecurity Mastery Path**

  * Deep CS fundamentals
  * Secure system design
  * Offensive & defensive security (long-term goal: GOAT level 🐐)

## 🧩 How I Think (This Is Important)

I strongly believe in:

* **Root-cause understanding over quick fixes**
* **Design first, code second**
* **Readable systems > clever hacks**
* **Documentation is part of engineering**
* **Failure handling is not optional**

If a system fails silently — it’s broken.

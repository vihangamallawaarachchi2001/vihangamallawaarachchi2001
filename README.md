# 👋 Hi, I’m Vihanga (VK)

### Software Engineer | System Architect | Researcher | Builder of Real Things

I’m a **problem-driven software engineer** who loves designing **robust systems**, **scalable architectures**, and **real-world solutions** — from web platforms to robotics middleware.

I care deeply about:

* **Correctness**
* **Architecture**
* **Failure handling**
* **Long-term maintainability**

I don’t just write code that works.
I make sure they **keep working under pressure**.
I design systems that **survive**, **scale**, and **fail gracefully**.

---

## 🧠 What I Actually Do

* 🏗️ **System Architecture** — designing fault-tolerant, modular, production-ready systems
* 🤖 **Robotics & Middleware** — assistive robots, intent engines, recovery systems
* 🔐 **Security & Reliability** — authentication, fault detection, secure logging
* 🌐 **Full-Stack Engineering** — from APIs to UI with clean separation of concerns
* 🧪 **Research-Oriented Development** — building with novelty, not copy-paste

---

## 🚀 Current Focus

* 🧠 **A.L.T.R.U.S** — *Adaptive Life-support & Therapeutic Robotic Unit System*

  > A Baymax-inspired assistive robot with:

  * Intent-driven middleware
  * Fault detection & auto-recovery
  * Blockchain-backed immutable event logging
  * Developer CLI & monitoring tools

* 🧩 **Middleware Engineering**

  * Intent arbitration engines
  * Modular plugin systems
  * Event-driven architectures

* 🛡️ **Cybersecurity Mastery Path**

  * Deep CS fundamentals
  * Secure system design
  * Offensive & defensive security (long-term goal: GOAT level 🐐)

## 🧰 Tech Stack (What I’m Comfortable Using *Properly* but open to learn anything new and adopt)

### Languages

* JavaScript / TypeScript
* Python
* Java
* Bash / Shell
* Go
* Rust
* C++
* C#

### Frontend

* React
* Next.js
* Zustand
* TanStack
* Tailwind CSS

### Backend

* Node.js
* REST APIs
* Django
* Fast API
* Nest.js
* Middleware-based architectures
* Authentication & session handling

### Systems & DevOps

* Linux (Ubuntu)
* Docker (working knowledge)
* CI/CD concepts
* CLI tool development

### Robotics & Research

* ROS (learning & integration)
* LiDAR-based navigation concepts
* Modular robotic software design
* Fault-tolerant systems

---

## What I’m Looking For

* Software Engineering roles (Backend / Full-Stack / Systems)
* Research-driven engineering teams
* Startups solving hard technical problems
* Teams that value engineering depth over hype

## 🧩 How I Think 

I strongly believe in:

* **Root-cause understanding over quick fixes**
* **Design first, code second**
* **Readable systems > clever hacks**
* **Documentation is part of engineering**
* **Failure handling is not optional**

If a system fails silently — it’s broken.
